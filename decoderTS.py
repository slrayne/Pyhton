"""
The following mappings will allow you to modify the decoding process.
After you run a frequency analysis, you will have the most common letter in your
encoded text.  Suppose the letter Q is the most common in the encoded text. We
would expect that to be the letter E.  In the mapping below, change the E INSIDE
the mapper to a Q.  In other words, the first line would read:
mapper['Q']='E' and so on.  Ensure that each letter only occurs once inside the brackets.
So the Q (second up from the bottom) would need to change.
